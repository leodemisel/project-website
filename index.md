## Introduction

All things on earth exist under the cold cruel hands of father Time, and the movie industry is no exception. It’d be easy to think that we, as intelligent beings, 
are above the concept of temporal bias, that the weather has no influence on our perception of movies and that in the Oscar season, the movie we vouch for is 
obviously our favorite, and not just the freshest in our memory. In actuality, our perception of a movie, just as our perception of a meal, can be very contextual, 
and what better context than time itself. We think that there are some correlations between a movie’s success and its release date within different time-frames and 
that the producers know it, and exploit it. Our goal is to show how us simple creatures are influenced by time in our perception of movies, and what are the 
strategies movie studios use to benefit from this bias, whether it's expressed within a month, a year, a decade or a lifetime. To this end, we need to ask ourselves 
a couple of questions.
